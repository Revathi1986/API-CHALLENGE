WEATHERPY AND VACATIONPY CHALLENGE
Python script is to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance. From the equator using Citypy, a simple Python library, and the Open Weather map API.
Totally 562 cities were examined with their coordinates data including Longitude and Latitude. Weather data includes Temperature, Humidity, Min Temperature, Max temperature, Pressure, Sealevel, Ground level, Wind speed, Sunrise, Sunset and Time zone 562 cities.
Data cleaning was done with the condition humidity >100. No data was available.
New data frame was constructed with Humidity < 100 and it was named as clean city data.
City Latitude vs Max Temperature Plot represents more hotness in Tropical zone and slightly distributed of hotness in Temperate zone.
Latitude vs cloudiness Plot represents Cloudiness is scattered in Tropical, Temperate zone. A bunch of points have been clouded near Artic zone in North pole and South pole.
When  r< 0.25 there is no relation between two variables, 0.25<r<0.5 it’s a weak relationship, 0.5<r<0.75 has moderate relationship and r>0.75 it’s a strong relationship between two variables, which could be used in linear regression plots.
Hervey Bay, Turaif, Arak, Jalu , Oruzgan, SantaRosalia are some of the cities fall under the condition Cloudiness = 0, Temperature =70 -80 degree and Wind speed > 10.
Shells Bay Resort, Swiss Spirit Hotel, Las Casitas, Santa Rosalia are the available near by Hotels.
So lets plan for a vacation…………….
